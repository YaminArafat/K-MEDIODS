# K-MEDIODS
The aim of this project is to implement k-mediods algorithm of unsupervised learning from scratch. 3 random numpy arrays(2-D) have been taken into consideration for this project. This code can be used to partition any given dataset into 'n' clusters where n can be any real number of user's choice.
